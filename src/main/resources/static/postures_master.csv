You can choose any comfortable posture, like easy pose, thunderbolt pose, lotus pose etc. If needed you can take the support of the wall as well. Keep your head, neck and back straight, while the hands are placed on the knees, palms facing downwards. Feel completely relaxed, physically and mentally for a few minutes, before starting the practice. 2. Inhale deeply and start by chanting ‘OM’ once with a deep, slow exhalation. Now, bring all your awareness to your breath. Feel the breath moving up and down, in and out, touching various parts of the body. Moving from the nose to the navel and back from the navel to the nose. The breath should be taken softly, that the sound of the breath is inaudible to the practitioner himself. 3. Notice how breathing is an effortless process. Give up all the effort and just experience the complete liberation gained in the process. Softer, longer, gentler and freer, that should be the way to breathe every day. 4. Keep the neck and shoulder in a line, the back straight and consciously prepare for the practice of Ajapa Japa. 5. Now, start breathing with Ujjayi breath. It requires the practitioner to contract the throat muscles as they breath in and release with breathing out. An oceanic wave like sound will come from the throat, signifying the contraction of the throat muscles. This breathing intensifies the calming effect by stimulating & soothing the nervous system. The flow of the breath is experienced from the nostril to the navel and back. 6. As you go deeper into the awareness of breath with Ujjayi breathing technique, chant the mantra ‘So-Ham’ or any mantra that resonates with you. In case of doubt. So-Ham is the best choice but if you have a guru mantra, nothing like it. 7. Now as you inhale, the air descends from the nostrils to the navel chant ‘So’. As you exhale, the air ascends from the navel to the nose, chant ‘Ham’. 8. Chant your guru mantra or personal mantra in a similar manner. Until this step we are consciously chanting the mantrasoham. After chanting for 10 minutes or more, it is time to shift to ajapa. 9. Synchronize the mantra with the breath and listen with awareness to the sound of the mantra, moving from the root chakra to the third eye and vice versa. The fusion of breath and mantra makes your concentration stable, reducing the mind’s tendency to wander. 10. Next, let go of the breath and focus your attention on the sound of the mantra alone. Breathe smoothly and let your awareness settle in the mantra. 11. As the mantra gains momentum, the sound of the mantra will naturally begin to pulse more effortlessly. Feel the vibrations of the mantra manifesting, as it flows subtly through your mind, centering your heart. Stay here for as long as you like. 12. For ending the process, slowly become aware of yourself and your surroundings. Chant Om three times and slowly open your eyes.",1,FALSE
